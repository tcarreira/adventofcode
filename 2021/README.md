You're on a ship at sea when the alarm goes off!
Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine.
It has an experimental antenna to track the keys, but you need to boost its signal strength
(a little meter indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars).

In order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles.
